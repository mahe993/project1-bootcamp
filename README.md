Ideas Market

- An app where users can come up with ideas and sell them on a marketplace.
- Each idea costs $9.90 to apply.
- Each idea will be reviewed independently before being approved.
- If the idea is approved, all patents/copyrights will be held by Ideas Market.
- The buyer of the idea holds the idea as a draft, and can make changes/relist the idea to the marketplace at a different price.
- Relisting of ideas are considered new ideas and will have to go through the application process as if it is a new idea.
- The buyer of the idea can act on the idea by applying for copyrights/patents and then conducting business thereafter.
- Ideas Market team will contact buyers applying for copyrights/patents for in-depth discussion on taking the business further.
- Ideas Market do not take responsibility for any failed business as a result of acting upon bought ideas.
